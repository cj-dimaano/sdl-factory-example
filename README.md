# SDL Factory Example

This is a remake of an old school project using SDL 2. The project requirements were to simulate a
factory with stationary consumer machines and producer machines and a robot. The robot is supposed
to pick up any payloads from a producer machine if the robot is not carrying anything and the
machine it is checking has a product. If the robot is carrying something, then it should drop off
its payload at any consumer machine that is not currently consuming a product. There were a few more
requirements for the assignment, but this is the basic idea behind the factory simulation.
